It sounds like you were expecting a simple drag-and-drop or menu option for text formatting, but since GitHub files use Markdown (which is text-based formatting), there isn't a direct "GUI" (Graphical User Interface) button for it.
However, many GitHub platforms, text editors, and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that work with Markdown do offer visual buttons or keyboard shortcuts to help you insert the Markdown syntax easily.
Here's how the "GUI" options usually look in an editor:
🖱️ Using GUI/Visual Buttons for Markdown
1. GitHub's Web Editor/Comment Boxes
When you are editing a file (like a README) directly on the GitHub website, or typing a comment in an issue/pull request, you'll often see a toolbar above the text box.
Look for these specific icons/buttons:
	• Bold: An icon that looks like a bold B or a filled square.
		○ Action: Select the text, click the B button, and it inserts the **text** syntax.
	• Italic: An icon that looks like an italic I.
		○ Action: Select the text, click the I button, and it inserts the *text* syntax.
	• Code: An icon that looks like < > or a small backtick.
		○ Action: Select the text, click the code button, and it inserts the `text` syntax.
2. Desktop Text Editors (like VS Code, Atom, etc.)
If you are using a dedicated editor to write your Markdown files before committing them to GitHub, they usually have built-in Markdown support with:
	• Keyboard Shortcuts:
		○ Bold: $\text{Ctrl}+\mathbf{B}$ (Windows/Linux) or $\text{Cmd}+\mathbf{B}$ (Mac).
		○ Italic: $\text{Ctrl}+\mathbf{I}$ (Windows/Linux) or $\text{Cmd}+\mathbf{I}$ (Mac).
	• Preview Mode: Most good editors have a Preview tab or button. This allows you to write the Markdown syntax on one side and instantly see how GitHub will render the text (with the correct font and size) on the other side.
Summary: The Workflow
Even with GUI buttons, the underlying action is still inserting the special characters (**, *, or `) into your file. The buttons just save you from typing the symbols yourself.
	1. Select the text you want to format.
	2. Click the corresponding icon (like B for bold).
	3. The editor automatically inserts the Markdown syntax around your selected text (e.g., it changes Hello to **Hello**).
